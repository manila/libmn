# libmn

This is my take on the standard C library.

The code loosely follows the guidlines to the libft project that is a part of the 42 curriculum.

These functions mirror the behavior of the C standard library:

## Building

**clone this repo:**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/manila/libmn.git libmn && cd libmn
```

**compile the libmn.a file:**
```
make
```

## Usage

Complile your program with the ```libmn``` library,
be sure to include the ```libmn.h``` header file in your c file(s)

```c
#include "libmn.h"
```
